# About the project
In this project I made a react app, which simulates a web shop<br/>
If you click on the category, you will see the products belonging to the actual category.<br/>
Clicking on "Hozzáad" button on the panels, you can add the product to your cart, after setting the quantity<br/>
You can also reduce the quantity by clicking the appropriate button on your cart.<br/>
If you press the "Számol" button you can see the price of your cart.
